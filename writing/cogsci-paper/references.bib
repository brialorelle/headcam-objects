This has led the field of language acquisition to posit specialized mechanisms that leverage the few words learned in the initial slow phase for faster vocabulary growth later. Simulations and mathematical analysis demonstrate that specialized cognitive changes are unnecessary. The acceleration in lexical acquisition is a necessary by-product of learning if (i) multiple words are learned in parallel and (ii) words are distributed such that there are few words that can be acquired quickly and many difficult ones.},

author = {Paul C. Quinn},
abstract = "The present research studied 3- and 4-month-old infants' ability to acquire two categories simultaneously. A familiarization-novelty preference procedure and geometrical form categories were used in all experiments. In Experiments I and 3, infants were familiarized with either a single form category, two form categories, or a single form category plus a set of forms that did not define a category. The results showed that, despite increased attentional and memorial demands, presentation of an additional form category did not harm the efficiency of categorization (Experiment 1) and changed the representation of the form category information from exemplars to a prototype (Experiment 3). Contrasting form information that was not categorical in structure decreased the infant's ability to recognize new members of the single familiar category (Experiment 1) and hindered the infant's ability to form a categorical representation (Experiment 3). The categorization behavior observed in Experiment 1, as indexed by the generalization of habituation to novel forms from a familiar category, was shown not to be a consequence of the inability to discriminate between individual members from the familiar form category (Experiment 2). The implications of these results for cognitive development are discussed."

  title = {Faces in early visual environments are persistent not just frequent},
  journal = {Vision Research},
  abstract = {The regularities in very young infants' visual worlds likely have out-sized effects on the development of the visual system because they comprise the first-in experience that tunes, maintains, and specifies the neural substrate from low-level to higher-level representations and therefore constitute the starting point for all other visual learning. Recent evidence from studies using head cameras suggests that the frequency of faces available in early infant visual environments declines over the first year and a half of life. The primary question for the present paper concerns the temporal structure of face experiences: Is frequency the key exposure dimension distinguishing younger and older infantsâ€™ face experiences, or is it the duration for which faces remain in view? Our corpus of head-camera images collected as infants went about their daily activities consisted of over a million individually coded frames sampled at 0.2 Hz from 232 h of infant-perspective scenes, recorded from 51 infants aged 1 month to 15 months. The major finding from this corpus is that very young infants (1â€“3 months) not only have more frequent face experiences but also more temporally persistent ones. The repetitions of the same very few face identities presenting up-close and frontal views are exaggerated in more persistent runs of the same face, and these persistent runs are more frequent for the youngest infants. The implications of early experiences consisting of extended repeated exposures of up-close frontal views for visual learning are discussed.}

abstract = {Cross-situational learning has recently gained attention as a plausible candidate for the mechanism that underlies the learning of word-meaning mappings. In a recent study, Blythe and colleagues have studied how many trials are theoretically required to learn a human-sized lexicon using cross-situational learning. They show that the level of referential uncertainty exposed to learners could be relatively large. However, one of the assumptions they made in designing their mathematical model is questionable. Although they rightfully assumed that words are distributed according to Zipf's law, they applied a uniform distribution of meanings. In this article, Zipf's law is also applied to the distribution of meanings, and it is shown that under this condition, cross-situational learning can only be plausible when referential uncertainty is sufficiently small. It is concluded that cross-situational learning is a plausible learning mechanism but needs to be guided by heuristics that aid word learners with reducing referential uncertainty.},
